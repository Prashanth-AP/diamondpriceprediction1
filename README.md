# Diamond Price Prediction

There are 10 independent variables (including id): The goal is to predict price of given diamond (Regression Analysis).

id : unique identifier of each diamond

carat : Carat (ct.) refers to the unique unit of weight measurement used exclusively to weigh gemstones and diamonds.

cut : Quality of Diamond Cut

color : Color of Diamond

clarity : Diamond clarity is a measure of the purity and rarity of the stone, graded by the visibility of these characteristics under 10-power magnification.

depth : The depth of diamond is its height (in millimeters) measured from the culet (bottom tip) to the table (flat, top surface)

table : A diamond's table is the facet which can be seen when the stone is viewed face up.

x : Diamond X dimension

y : Diamond Y dimension

x : Diamond Z dimension

Target variable:

price: Price of the given Diamond.
